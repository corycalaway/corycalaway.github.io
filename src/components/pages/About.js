            throughout my life. Some of these experiences have been difficult, but they have made me the individual I am today. They 
            have also tought me that even though I am strong as an individual, I can accomplish more with a team. <br />
            <br />
            I am still continuing to learn and edcuate myself as a fullstack Web Developer. I am currently on track to completeing a 
            fullstack web development course from the University of Utah (Grad: May2021). Upon completion I am hoping to start a full
            time career as a Web Developer.
